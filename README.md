**Goal**: The user should be able to type into the input and, when they click a button, change the greeting to whatever they want. 

We need to see on the screen/manipulate:
(this ends up being a list of everything that needs an id in javascrip)
1) Greeting
2) Text input
3) Button

Let's go _grab_ everything we need:
1) grab the greeting
   - Validate by logging out
2) grab the input
   - Validate by logging out
3) grab the button
   - Validate by logging out

_When_ do we want this to happen?
When the user clicks the button.

OnClick:
1) Validate that the button is listening.
    - Print time of click
2) Get the user input from the text iput element
    - log out the user input
3) Change the 'textContent' property of the greeting element to the user input.
    - Change greeting to user input
